# Khan-academy
This is all the programming projects and assignments in Khan academy I have finished. I have begun this to work on my acutal computer programming skills. I have a very firm grasp on many academic topics I still wanted some practice with regular programming. So completeing the khan academy courses seemed like an interactive and interesting way to do that. All of this code can be verified since my login for khan academy is the same as my email. Also it can be tested at https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs by simply copying and pasting the code.
